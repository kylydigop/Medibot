       " Document(page_content='2.1 DYSPEPSIA\\nDyspepsia is a term used to describe a collection of symptoms \\nincluding upper abdominal discomfort and pain, heartburn, acid reflux (with or without bloating), nausea and vomiting related to eating. It may be caused by non-ulcer dyspepsia (diagnosis made by endoscopy), GORD, peptic ulcer disease (gastric or duodenal) or a hiatus hernia. \\nDifferential diagnoses\\nCardiac pain is frequently mistaken for dyspeptic pain and is often difficult to \\ndistinguish – pain travelling down the arm which is not relieved by antacids is \\none possible distinguishing symptom and consider accompanying symptoms \\nsuch as pale/cold/clammy/breathing difficulties. Identify other medicines that \\nare being taken to rule out an adverse effect, eg NSAIDs, iron, bisphosphonates \\nor corticosteroids. Irritable bowel syndrome may also present with similar \\nsymptoms, especially accompanied by bloating, although there would usually \\nalso be abnormal bowel habits reported. Motility disorders may also be a \\npossibility, which would require referral to the GP. Biliary colic may also present as epigastric pain precipitated by eating.\\nTreatment options\\nSimple antacids \\nThere is limited evidence on the efficacy of antacids in the management of \\ndyspepsia; however, symptomatic relief is often reported with the use of an \\nantacid or alginate. They are best given when symptoms occur or are expected, ie after meals and at bedtime. They also remain in the stomach for longer at \\nthese times, and therefore have longer to act. Antacids should preferably not be \\ntaken at the same time as other drugs as they may impair absorption. ALARM symptoms are defined as: \\n¡ gastro-intestinal bleeding (may present as ‘coffee grounds’ in vomit or \\nmalaena) \\n¡ dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) \\n¡ progressive unintentional weight loss \\n¡ persistent vomiting \\n¡ also iron deficiency anaemia; an epigastric mass; swallowing difficulties, anaemia or suspicious barium meal, all of which may be identified by a GP examination\\nSymptom severity is a poor indicator of an underlying disease.

If heartburn is experienced regularly, investigation \\nby endoscopy may reveal oesophagitis (inflammation of the inner lining of the oesophagus).\\nThis may lead to complications such as oesophageal stricture or Barrett’s \\noesophagus where the normal cube-shaped cells that line the gullet become \\nreplaced by elongated cells as a result of damage from the stomach acid. \\nLong-standing and untreated Barrett’s oesophagus may lead to ulcer and a \\nhigher tendency to undergo malignant change.

       " Document(page_content='Differential diagnoses\\nCardiac pain is often difficult to distinguish from dyspeptic pain. Cardiac pain \\nwill not be relieved by antacid, is brought on by exercise and relieved by rest \\nand glyceryl trinitrate (GTN). It can travel down either arm but this is not a very \\nuseful distinguishing feature and again may have accompanying features e.g. \\npale/cold/clammy.\\nTreatment options\\nProton pump inhibitors (PPIs) such as omeprazole, pantoprazole and \\nesomeprazole. PPIs inhibit gastric acid secretion by blocking the hydrogen-\\npotassium adenosine triphosphatase enzyme system (the proton pump) of the \\ngastric parietal cell. Evidence refers to effectiveness at healing ulcers rather \\nthan for relieving symptoms of GORD. It shows that proton pump inhibitors are \\nmore effective at healing than H2 antagonists or antacids. NICE (2014) states \\nthat they can be used ‘on-demand’ to relieve symptoms as they occur. They are well-tolerated drugs with side effects reported as diarrhoea, headaches \\nand dizziness. Omeprazole 10mg tablets may be sold for short-term relief of \\nreflux-like symptoms in adults aged over 18 years for a maximum of four weeks. \\nEsomeprazole is licensed for adults aged 18 years and over for a maximum \\ntreatment period of 14 days.\\nH\\n2 receptor antagonists improve symptoms of GORD more than antacids or \\nalginates (See p11). Alginates form a ‘raft’ on the stomach contents and therefore \\nprovide symptomatic relief in reflux and protect the oesophageal mucosa, e.g. \\nGaviscon® liquid. \\nAntacids may provide symptomatic relief in GORD (See p11).\\nPRACTICAL TIPS\\nIt is not known whether losing weight, stopping smoking, reducing the \\nintake of alcohol, caffeine or fatty foods will help reduce symptoms of GORD. However this is sensible, healthy lifestyle advice and will not cause harm. \\nEating smaller meals may help. A small study looked at raising the head of \\nthe bed in GORD and found small improvements in self-reported symptoms. One possible cause of reflux disease is transient relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter; lying flat may therefore increase reflux episodes \\nbecause gravity does not then prevent acid regurgitation.Ref: NICE CG184 \\nDyspepsia and GORD. \\nSept 2014\\nCOMMON CLINICAL CONDITIONS AND MINOR AILMENTS\\n15', metadata={'source': 'data\\\\common_clinical_conditions_and_minor_ailments.pdf', 'page': 15}),\n",

Symptoms are due to \\nthe passive transfer of gastric contents into the oesophagus due to transient \\nor chronic relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter. Infants often present \\nwith frequent vomiting at less than 6 weeks old. Spontaneous resolution often \\noccurs at 12-18 months. Regular treatment will be warranted if the regurgitation \\nis frequent. Half of babies under the age of 3 months bring up their food at least \\nonce a day. Referral will be required if any feeding difficulties or failure to thrive are suspected. \\nThickened feeds reduce the severity and frequency of regurgitation in most \\ncases, e.g. Instant Carobel® powder, which is carob seed flour. These should be \\nused on the advice of the health visitor or GP. Sodium alginate may also be used \\nto reduce the frequency of regurgitation, e.g. Gaviscon Infant® sachets.

       " Document(page_content='2.3 COLIC\\nColic usually starts when a baby is a few weeks old and stops \\nat four or five months of age. No one knows what causes it, although theories include lactose sensitivity, wind or painful bowel cramps or the baby detecting the worry or anxiousness of the parents. Colic is excessive crying in an otherwise healthy baby and is defined as being present when babies cry for at least three hours a day, for three days a week, for at least three weeks.\\nSigns that a baby might have colic are:\\n¡ the baby will often start crying suddenly; the cry is high-pitched and nothing \\nthe parent does seems to help \\n¡ the crying begins at the same time each day, often in the afternoon or evening \\n¡ the baby might draw their legs up when they cry, and their tummy might look swollen \\n¡ the baby might clench their hands \\n¡ the baby’s face flushes \\n¡ the crying can last for minutes or hours \\n¡ the crying often calms down when the baby is exhausted or when they have \\npassed wind or a stool\\n1. Failure to thrive. Although this is hard to assess as a pharmacist, signs to look for would be the general appearance of the baby, their alertness and responsiveness.

It can be \\nassociated with sinusitis, where the mucus is thicker and more purulent, or with \\nhayfever/allergic rhinitis, where the discharge is often watery. In young children, postnasal drip may be associated with a foreign body in the nose and this \\npossibility should be excluded.¡ Very high temperature or shortness of breath accompanied by a cough \\nshould be urgently referred to rule out more serious infection, such as pneumonia.

These infections may be harder to treat and are \\noften resistant to fluconazole.\\nSymptoms are vulval itching, local erythema, vaginal discharge which is white, \\ncurd-like and odourless, dyspareunia (pain on intercourse) and dysuria (pain \\nduring urination). Self-diagnosis is made in the majority of cases although only half of these are suspected to be correct. If a woman has not experienced \\nsymptoms before, the diagnosis should be confirmed by a GP. Women of \\nchildbearing age are more susceptible to infection as the yeast prefers \\nan oestrogen-rich environment. A woman who is either aged over 60yrs, \\nunder 16yrs or pregnant should be referred. It is a common infection during \\npregnancy and more difficult to treat. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are a common \\nprecipitating factor.  \\nDifferential diagnoses\\nSymptoms of cystitis and thrush are often confused due to dysuria, but there is \\nusually no discharge with cystitis. It is also difficult to distinguish between the signs of thrush and bacterial vaginosis, which is a more common vulvovaginal infection but usually presents without itch. Other possible infections are \\ntrichomoniasis (frothy, grey, malodorous discharge), chlamydia (no itch), \\ngonorrhoea (pain and fever usually present) and genital herpes (pain is a \\ndefining symptom). If any of these are suspected, referral to the GP is required.\\nTreatment options\\nTopical preparations \\nThe imidazoles; clotrimazole, econazole and miconazole are equally effective. \\nThe treatment is dose dependent rather than dependent on duration. \\nIntravaginal treatment, via a pessary or intravaginal cream, is more effective \\nthan external application of the cream alone, although this will sooth and relieve vulval symptoms.

Simple \\nanalgesia will usually be sufficient as this will usually be a self-limiting condition. \\nOnly if ear pain is severe or persisting for three or more days should referral be \\nnecessary.\\nGlue ear (otitis media with effusion) is a condition where the middle ear becomes \\nfilled with fluid that looks like glue. If this is suspected, e.g if there is continuing \\ndulled hearing, referral is necessary.\\nTreatment options\\nProducts to soften the ear wax (cerumenolytics) are the most appropriate \\nfirst-line choice for impacted ear wax. When urea-hydrogen peroxide (Otex®, \\nExterol®) comes into contact with water, hydrogen peroxide is liberated, \\nwhich has cerumenolytic activity in vitro. Cerumenolytics work by hydrating \\nthe desquamated sheets of corneocytes, which are the major constituent of \\ncerumen plugs, and subsequently inducing keratolysis with disintegration of the \\nwax. \\nThere is little evidence to suggest superiority of one product. PRODIGY \\nrecommends warm tap water, sodium chloride 0.9% or sodium bicarbonate ear \\ndrops. They also include olive oil and almond oil as they are popular choices \\namongst patients. Organic solvents contained in some proprietary preparations can irritate the ear canal and therefore simple remedies are preferred. The \\nadvantage of proprietary preparations is that they contain instructions for use \\nand an appropriate dropper which may be preferred by some patients. \\nPeople with nut allergies should not use almond oil. Sodium bicarbonate ear \\ndrops may cause dryness of the ear canal. The preparation should be applied \\ngenerously, and then the patient should lie with the affected ear uppermost for \\nfive to ten minutes to allow the softening preparation to penetrate. \\nIf deafness or pain persists, referral for irrigation after softening the wax may be \\nnecessary. Patients with a previously perforated ear drum should not have their \\near irrigated and persistence with ear wax softeners may be more useful.\\nSimple analgesia is appropriate for ear pain, e.g. paracetamol or ibuprofen.\\nCOMMON CLINICAL CONDITIONS AND MINOR AILMENTS\\n135', metadata={'source': 'data\\\\common_clinical_conditions_and_minor_ailments.pdf', 'page': 135}),\n",

The ear is a self-cleaning system. Cotton buds may also scratch or irritate the external ear canal leading to inflammation which would aggravate the condition.\\nIf otitis externa is a problem, avoidance of irritants will help, e.g. using ear \\nplugs or cotton wool coated in white soft paraffin in the ear when showering or bathing. Cotton wool should not be left in the ear, as this does not allow discharge or debris to be cleared from the ear.\\nIf a child is experiencing recurrent problems with acute otitis media, \\nawareness of the risk factors may allow avoidance.

The age and health of the individual including co-existing \\ndiseases will affect the healing time. \\nFirst aid for thermal burns consists of immersing the affected area in cold \\nwater for 20-30 minutes within three hours of injury. This can help to reduce \\ninflammation, redness and pain. Care must be taken not to overdo this as \\nprolonged cooling can cause tissue damage. Chemical burns require irrigation \\nand removal of contaminated clothing and substances. \\nTreatment with wound dressings aims to prevent infection and provide a warm, \\nmoist environment in which to encourage skin regeneration. Creams should not \\nbe applied to a burn.\\nTreatment options\\nPain relief such as paracetamol or ibuprofen is useful if required. Little research \\nis available on wound dressings and their effectiveness in treating and \\npromoting the healing of burns and scalds. Dressings may be used to promote \\nhealing and to protect the skin: Alginate, paraffin gauze and clear film dressings \\nare all appropriate.\\nChlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine have been shown to prolong healing times  \\nand should not be used.If the burn is greater than the size of the patient’s hand or if it is on the \\nface, urgent referral should be made. If it is a deep burn, heavily blistered or painful, then urgent referral is also advisable.\\nIf there is any shortness of breath or respiratory problems following \\na chemical burn, urgent referral is necessary.DANGER SYMPTOMSSuperficial partial thickness burns are defined as those which affect the epidermis and upper dermis. Thermal burns are caused by sufficient exposure to heat to damage these layers of the skin, e.g. from electrical items such as hot irons, or sunburn (see below). Scalds are thermal burns caused by hot liquids.

The tick \\nshould be removed using tick removers or tweezers and should be grasped as \\nclose as possible close to the skin and pulled straight upwards, in a slow, steady \\nmotion, without jerking. \\nTraditional methods for removing ticks include use of petroleum jelly and \\napplying a lit match or hot needle. These methods are not recommended as \\nthey may encourage the tick to release more saliva which increases the risk of \\nbacterial infection. The bite area should be cleaned and checked regularly to \\nsee if a rash appears. In that case, referral to the GP is necessary as this may be \\na sign of Lyme disease, which is difficult to diagnose. It often lies dormant for \\nyears but early symptoms are chills, fever, headache and joint aches and pains.\\nMammalian bites are most commonly caused by dogs and cats and occur most \\nfrequently in children. Human bites are also a possibility either due to playing \\nor fighting in children or as a result of physical or sexual abuse in adults. Mixed \\naerobic and anaerobic bacterial infection is possible with mammalian bites. Deep \\npuncture wounds, particularly to the hand, may require antibiotic treatment and \\nit is advisable that the tetanus immunisation is updated.Insect bites, e.g. by a midge or mosquito, cause irritation and \\ninflammation where the skin has been bitten.

       " Document(page_content='APPENDIX 3: A SUMMARY OF CHILDHOOD INFECTIONS\\nChickenpox: Chickenpox is caused by a herpes virus, the varicella-zoster virus \\n(VZV). It remains a common childhood infection. Chickenpox is highly infectious \\nfrom person-to-person contact. It has a relatively long incubation period of \\n10 to 21 days and the rash is usually preceded by a day or two of fever. The \\nrash is quite distinctive, with crops of small, raised, red spots that develop into \\nvesicles (blisters) of varying size, lasting three to five days. The rash is variable \\nbut generally occurs more on the head and trunk than on the limbs. Mild cases \\nmay have no spots at all, while, in severe cases (especially in immunodeficient \\npatients), the body may be completely covered. The patient is infectious from \\ntwo days prior to the eruption of the rash until all the spots have crusted over. Most children with chickenpox recover uneventfully, with no specific treatment.\\nAntipyretics may be useful if there is fever present.\\nChickenpox in pregnancy may be harmful to the foetus, and is particularly \\ndangerous if contracted just before delivery when chickenpox in the newborn, \\nacquired from a non-immune mother, may be fatal. If the mother is definitely \\nimmune there is no risk to the baby. Any pregnant woman or newborn baby who \\nhas been in contact with, or is showing signs of, chickenpox should be referred \\nto a doctor immediately. \\nShingles (Herpes zoster): After primary chickenpox infection, the varicella-zoster \\nvirus may lie dormant for many years in the dorsal root nerve ganglia, adjacent \\nto the spinal cord. The virus may erupt at any time in the skin area supplied by \\nthat ganglion, in the form of a localised, painful, red, blistering rash known as \\nshingles. It is less common in children than in adults. It may recur, especially \\nwhen immunity is suppressed. Susceptible people can contract chickenpox \\nfrom people with active shingles, but it is not possible to “catch” shingles from anyone. \\nMeasles: After recent controversy with the combined MMR vaccine, there have \\nbeen reports of increased incidence of measles. In measles, after two or three \\ndays of fever, cold symptoms and malaise, the typical rash emerges. This is a \\nred, confluent, blotchy rash that begins at the hairline and progresses down \\nto cover the whole body and lasts three days. Complications are common and \\ninclude otitis media, laryngitis, pneumonia and, rarely, a fatal, progressive \\nencephalitis. \\nMumps: This is caused by a paramyxovirus. Fever is accompanied by painful \\nswelling of one or both parotid glands (these are salivary glands not lymph \\nnodes), seen over and behind the angle of the jaw, and extending backwards \\nbehind the earlobe. One of the diagnostic features is pain on swallowing as a \\nresult of this swelling. Symptomatic treatment only is required, and recovery is usually uneventful over a week. Complications include encephalitis, pancreatitis, \\nand orchitis (infection of the testes in post-pubertal males that may cause \\ninfertility), which is the main justification for the immunisation programme. \\nRubella (German measles): This is characterised by symptoms of a cold, fever, \\nand then, about two days later, a generalised red rash and swelling of the lymph \\nnodes. Its main significance is the high risk of damage to the foetus if contracted \\nby women in early pregnancy. For this reason, all infants are now routinely \\nvaccinated against rubella and, therefore, the infection is now uncommon.\\nCOMMON CLINICAL CONDITIONS AND MINOR AILMENTS\\n189', metadata={'source': 'data\\\\common_clinical_conditions_and_minor_ailments.pdf', 'page': 189}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Meningococcal disease: This serious bacterial infection still causes a significant \\nnumber of deaths and permanent disability. It is crucial to recognise and treat \\nit early. The meningococcus organism causes both septicaemia and meningitis, \\nbut it is the septicaemia that kills rapidly, and that also causes the characteristic rash. Typically, the septicaemia presents as fever and general malaise, not \\nnecessarily with symptoms of meningitis. The rash may then appear rapidly \\nanywhere on the body. The rash is blotchy and dark purple, like bruising under \\nthe skin, and does not fade (blanch) when a glass is pressed against it. \\nAny unwell child presenting with a new, developing, dark purple rash should be \\nsent immediately to hospital. First-aid treatment in primary care is intramuscular \\npenicillin, but this should not delay transfer of the child to hospital. Household \\ncontacts of definite cases may need to be given prophylactic rifampicin. The \\nrecently introduced vaccine prevents only the C strain of meningococcus. Cases \\ncaused by the more common B strain still occur. \\nErythema infectiosum (slapped cheek disease, fifth disease): This infection \\nis caused by a parvovirus. The most characteristic feature is the prominent \\nred rash on the face, hence the “slapped cheek” description, followed by a \\ngeneralised rash. The preceding fever is variable and may be absent. As with \\nrubella, its significance is in the potential harm to the foetus in pregnancy.\\nHand, foot and mouth disease: This is caused by a Coxsackie virus. A mild fever \\nis followed three to five days later by a characteristic vesicular rash inside the \\nmouth and on the tongue, hands and sometimes the feet. It resolves after about \\na week.\\nPertussis (whooping cough): Unlike the other diseases that are routinely \\nimmunised against, pertussis remains quite common. The vaccine is less effective than the others, and babies under 2 months - the age of the first \\nimmunisation - are particularly vulnerable. Babies often contract the infection \\nfrom a partially immune older sibling who may have no more than a slight \\ncough. Infants may present with dramatic, spasmodic coughing fits, during \\nwhich they find it impossible to breathe in, and they may go blue or vomit. \\nYoung babies may even stop breathing, and the disease can be fatal. The \\ncharacteristic “whoop” is heard only in older children. Fever and malaise are \\ngenerally mild, but the cough can be very troublesome and can go on for several \\nweeks. The causative organism, Bordetella pertussis, is a bacterium sensitive to erythromycin, but unfortunately treatment is only effective if given early. \\nOnce established, no treatment has much effect. Any baby or young child that \\nhas a spasmodic cough with vomiting should see a doctor. Babies will generally \\nneed hospital admission, but older children can be looked after at home. Any infant contact of a child with possible pertussis symptoms should be given \\nprophylactic erythromycin, even if completely asymptomatic.\\nRef: Scott-Jupp R. \\nChildhood diseases: \\nInfections.
